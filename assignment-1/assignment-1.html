    <h2 class="css">What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media.</li>
        <li><span class="a">CSS is not necessary</span><span class="b"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can contol the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <li class="c">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files. </li>
    </ol> <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="css">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <span class="f">
    <ul type="disc">
        <li class="d">Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li class="d">Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li class="d">External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li class="d">The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. how ever, 
            <span class="b">in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>
             because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class 
        applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,
        applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in 
        that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element 
        and it's used by JavaSript.</p><br>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range 
        of elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a 
        style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p><br>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most
         commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements 
         to which a style should be applied</p><br>
